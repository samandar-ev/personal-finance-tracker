I used Mac for coding. It turns out the node modules for Mac and Windows differs. In case if code does not load properly on other systems, I suggest deleting node modules and reinstalling them.

Additionally, when I tested my app with PCs at WIUT PC lab, the server could not establish connection with MongoDB. I tried to add IP to whitelist on MongoDB wesbite but it did not help. I guess network at WIUT kinda prevents such connections as I allowed to connect to the DB from any part of the world. If you are using WIUT's internet network (WiFi) for running the code, it cannot connect to MongoDB. Therefore, I recommend changing network if code does not load correctly.

One more thing: The app requires creating account to use it. I know creating account and loading data for testing might be time consuming to you. That's why, I created an account with pre-loaded data for your convenience. You can find account details below:
